## Setup

Clone the repo:
    git clone https://github.com/ameyp/dotfiles

Change directory to where you cloned the repo
    cd dotfiles

Run the bootstrap script
    sh install.sh

## Todo

- Implement `command_not_found_handler` to auto-install (whitelisted? all?) commands via the system's package manager on first use.
